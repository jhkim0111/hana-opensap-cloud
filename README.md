Software Development on SAP HANA
openSAP HANA7 Course Exercises Updated for SAP Cloud Platform, HANA Cloud service, and Cloud Application Programming Model (July 2020)
Inpsired by both the HANA Native and Cloud Application Programming Model openSAP courses
- <https://open.sap.com/courses/hana7>
- <https://open.sap.com/courses/cp7>

## Description

With the delivery of SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 05 and SAP HANA Cloud service, we see many new features in both the underlying SAP HANA infrastructure and in the custom development aspects of SAP HANA native development. In this course, we’ll start from the assumption that students are familiar with the basics of the previous courses. This will allow us to dive deeper on key topics from real world applications. We’ll also cover new functionality added in SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 05 and SAP HANA Cloud services, especially the evolution of the core programming model to focus on Cloud Application Programming Model.

Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn how to use Business Application Studio or Visual Studio Code to develop both HDI and XSA/CF-based applications for SAP HANA on-premise or on SAP Cloud Platform.

We’ll also focus on real-world problems and opportunities such as:

- Cross-container and external reporting tool access to containers
- Realistic yet easier-to-maintain security setup
- The power of modern programming models
- SQL DDL-based database object creation
- New Cloud Application Programming Model concepts for service enablement and UI annotations and Fiori UI creation
- More open source components and techniques

## Requirements

Basic programming knowledge including HTML, JavaScript, and SQL
Baseline SAP HANA development knowledge from one of the previous SAP HANA courses on openSAP would be helpful
The exercises in this course in this version/branch are primarily designed so that you can execute them on SAP Cloud Platform and SAP HANA Cloud service as of July 2020. They have also been tested in SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 04 and SPS 05 with XSA on premise.
